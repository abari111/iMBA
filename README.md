Having an MBA from a renowned institute opens doors, allowing us to take a significant leap in our career. Pursuing an MBA is costly and requires resources. Inspired by the Personal MBA by Josh Kaufman, I decide to create a customized MBA program for myself and make it public. If you have stumbled upon this repository by chance, let me tell you one thing: I am not an expert, and I don't know anyone in my circle who has done an MBA. Until the opportunity presents to me, I content myself with this.

Let build it collaboratively.
